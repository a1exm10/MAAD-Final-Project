           <p>Congratulations, you've just completed a brief trip
           through meme history and witnesed the many layers that connect memes. I hope you've now come to realize
           that memes are just as much a part of our history as anything else. They are an essential part of the
           collective internet culture and are something that we all contibute to simply by the very act of interaction.
          Next time you're on social media try and count just how many memes you see in a single sitting,
          it might be more than you think!

           <p>“We have the power to defy the selfish genes of our birth and, if necessary,
              the selfish memes of our indoctrination. We can even discuss ways of deliberately
               cultivating and nurturing pure, disinterested altruism--something that has no place
                in nature, something that has never existed before in the whole history of the world.
                 We are built as gene machines and cultured as meme machines, but we have the power to
                  turn against our creators. We, alone on earth, can rebel against the tyranny of the
                   selfish replicators.” -Richard Dawkins (again)</p>
